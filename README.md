## Requirements

.NET, Visual Studio (I used VS2017 Community), nuget (nuget should be allowed to install dependent packages)

## Compilation

This API was tested using PostMan and ran from local IIS Express server (Visual Studio default).

- Build the project
- Run the debugger

## Notes

This was a fun challenge, and I had one more thing I wanted to do (error responses), but I won't be able to come back to this until the weekend (which would be too late). Everything else seems to be working fine. Thanks
